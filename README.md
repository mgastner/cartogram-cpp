Data produced by code in this repository are subject to the MIT license found [here](./LICENSE) and should cite the aforementioned paper by Gastner et al. (2018).

While cloning this repository, please ensure you use the `--recurse-submodules` flag like so:

```shell script
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/mgastner/cartogram-cpp.git
```

## Dependencies

Please note, we only support UNIX-based systems, and have only tested on macOS, Linux, and GNU. That being said, the program should work on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) as well, for which we have conducted minor testing.

### macOS

#### Installing Homebrew

Install [homebrew](brew.sh) by running the following command:

```shell script
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

#### Installing dependencies through Homebrew

Install pkg-config, boost, fftw, nlohmann-json, and cmake by running the following command:

```shell script
brew install libomp pkg-config boost fftw nlohmann-json cmake cairo
```

### Debian-based distributions (Ubuntu, Arch Linux etc.)

#### Installing relevant dependencies through apt:

Have a look through to apt-requirements.txt if you'd like to see what all will be installed. Then, run the following commands to install all dependencies through apt:

```shell script
apt install -y g++-11 build-essential cmake libboost-all-dev nlohmann-json3-dev libomp-dev libfftw3-dev libcairo2-dev
```

### Windows (Using WSL)

For Windows users, we recommend using our program through Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

Please install [Ubuntu](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9pdxgncfsczv) from the Microsoft Store, and then follow the same instructions as for Debian-based distributions (found above).

We recommend you to compile outside the `/mnt` directory, as compiling in the `/mnt` directory may lead to unexpected behavior.

### Installation

Go to the `cartogram-cpp` directory in your preferred terminal and execute the following commands.

```shell script
cmake -B build
make -C build
sudo make install -C build
```

If your computer has multiple cores, you may use the `make` command with the `-j` flag to use all your cores, or `-j` followed by a number to use the specified number of cores (for example, `-j4` to use 4 cores). You may perform the entire installation at once with:

```shell script
sudo cmake -B build && sudo make install -j -C build
```

Using lesser cores than you have is recommended so that your computer still has some headroom for other tasks. Thus, it may be a good idea for you to modify the above snippet, appending your preferred number of cores to `-j`.

#### Installing using VScode

If you are using VScode, you may also install the program by running the `CMake: Install` command from the command palette (accessible via `Ctrl/Command + Shift + P`). By default, VSCode builds the `DEBUG` version. If you would like to build the `RELEASE` version, you may change the build type in the `CMake: Select Variant` command. The `RELEASE` version will be much faster.

If you encounter any issues, please look at the troubleshooting section below, especially the last bullet point.

### Troubleshooting

- If compilation suddenly stopped working for you, you may remove the `build` directory with `rm -rf build` and run the installation commands again.
- If running `cmake -B build` gives you an error, it is likely that a dependency was not installed correctly. Rerun the appropriate commands above to install the required dependencies and try again.
- If you get an error which mentions permission issues, try running the command that gave you the error with `sudo` prefixed, as done with `sudo make install -C build` above.
- If `cmake` complains that it could not find a particular library, please try uninstalling it and installing it again. After reinstalling it, please also unlink it and link it with the `--force` flag.
- If you get errors related to CGAL, it's likely you have another version of CGAL installed on your computer that is getting chosen instead of the one contained as a submodule within this repository. It's also possible that when cloning this repository, the `--recurse-submodule` flag was missing. Try running `git submodule init` and `git submodule update` in the root directory of the repository.
- If VScode's `CMake: Install` does not work, make sure you own `/usr/local/bin` and the working directory. You may assign ownership to your account with `sudo chown -R $(whoami) .`, replacing `.` with the directory of choice.

### Usage

Run the following command (replace `your-geojson-file.geojson` file with your geographic data and `your-csv-file.csv` with your visual variables file, containing target areas for each geographic region):

```shell script
cartogram your-geojson-file.geojson your-csv-file.csv
```

-   The first argument's input is a GeoJSON or JSON file, in the standard GeoJSON format.
-   The second argument's input is a `.csv` file with data about target areas.

_Note: use the `-h` flag to display more options._

The CSV file should be in the following format:

| NAME_1     | Data (e.g., Population) | Color   |
| :--------- | :---------------------- | :------ |
| Bruxelles  | 1208542                 | #e74c3c |
| Vlaanderen | 6589069                 | #f1c40f |
| Wallonie   | 3633795                 | #34495e |

-   `NAME_1` should be the same as the identifying property's name in the GeoJSON. The rows should also have the same data as is present in the identifying property.
-   `Data` contains the data you would like your cartogram to based on.
-   `Color` is the color you would like the geographic region to be. Colors may be represented in the following manner:

    1.  `cornflowerblue`: html color codes supported by `CSS3` (case-insensitive), full list of supported colors may be found in the "Extended colors" section of [web colors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors).
    2.  `"rgb(255, 0, 120)"` or `rgb(255 0 120)` or `"255, 0, 120"` or `255 0 120`: red, green and blue values out of 255.
    3.  `#e74c3c`: hex code of color, must start with `#`.

You may find sample GeoJSON (containing geographic data) and CSV (containing information about target areas, colors and other visual variables) files in the `cartogram-cpp/sample_data` directory.

To test whether whether the program was installed successfully and is working fine, you may run the following command from the repository root:

```shell script
cartogram sample_data/world_by_country_since_2022/world_by_country_since_2022.geojson sample_data/world_by_country_since_2022/world_population_by_country_2010.csv --plot_polygons --world
```

You may inspect the resultant SVG to check if everything looks as expected.

### Testing

If you'd like to contribute to the project, please run our tests after you make any changes.

To run the unit tests, execute the following command:

```shell script
ctest --verbose
```

To learn more about the tests, you may go to the `cartogram-cpp/tests` directory and read the `README.md` file.

Additionally, you may go to the `cartogram-cpp/tests` directory and run the following command:

```shell script
bash stress_test.sh
```

### Benchmarking

To benchmark the program, first install [hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine). You can install it using Homebrew on macOS:

```shell script
brew install hyperfine
```

Or using apt on Debian-based distributions:

```shell script
apt install hyperfine
```

Then, go to the `cartogram-cpp/tests` directory and run the following command:

```shell script
bash stress_test.sh
```

### Uninstallation

Go to the `cartogram-cpp` directory in your preferred terminal and execute the following command:

```shell script
sudo make uninstall -C build
```

Upon successful uninstallation, the following will be outputted:

    > Built target uninstall

Further, running `cartogram` should no longer work.
